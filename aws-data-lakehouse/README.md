## Project Overview

This project implements a serverless data lakehouse architecture on AWS to deliver daily marketing analytics reports for the marketing agency. The solution leverages AWS's serverless components (S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena, Step Functions) to create a scalable, cost-efficient platform that processes marketing data from the Affise API.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Scheduled twice-daily data processing workflow
- **Serverless Architecture**: Zero infrastructure management with pay-per-use model
- **Optimized Query Performance**: Data stored in analytics-optimized formats
- **Incremental Processing**: 7-day rolling window to manage Athena query timeouts
- **Robust Error Handling**: Automatic retries and failure notifications
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time marketing insights via QuickSight visualizations

## Solution Architecture

The solution follows modern data lakehouse principles with distinct data layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw JSON data from Affise API stored in S3
- **Silver Layer**: Processed/transformed data in Parquet format
- **Gold Layer**: Analytics-ready data in Athena tables
- **Presentation Layer**: Interactive QuickSight dashboards for business users

### Step Function Workflow

![Step Functions Workflow](./image/step-functions.png)

#### Workflow Steps

1. **Start**
2. **adstart_update_dimension_tables (Lambda Function)**

   - Fetches the latest offer data from the Affise API
   - Transforms and loads data to dimension tables in S3
   - Ensures up-to-date offer details before report generation

3. **Delete data from table daily_report_sub5_output (Athena SQL)**

   - Clears data from the past 7 days to prevent duplicates
   - Limits the query scope to avoid Athena timeouts

4. **Insert data to daily_report_sub5_output (Athena SQL)**

   - Transforms and combines offer data with click and conversion metrics
   - Inserts processed data for the past 7 days into reporting table
   - Joins multiple data sources including offers, affiliates, and advertisers

5. **export-sub5-report (Lambda Function)**

   - Queries the final dataset from Athena
   - Formats data as CSV with proper column ordering and escaping
   - Uploads report to S3 for Marketing team access
   - Data made available for QuickSight dashboard refreshes

6. **End**

## Dashboard & Analytics

The culmination of the data pipeline is an interactive QuickSight dashboard that provides critical marketing insights:

### Key Dashboard Features

- **Daily Performance Metrics**: Conversion rates, click-through rates, and revenue by day
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: Campaign performance analysis across different affiliates
- **Geographic Analysis**: Country-level performance metrics with regional breakdowns
- **Advertiser ROI Tracking**: Revenue and conversion metrics by advertiser
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance with period-over-period comparisons
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Dynamic filters for dates, campaigns, affiliates, and more

The dashboard is refreshed automatically when new data becomes available through the twice-daily pipeline runs, ensuring marketing teams always have access to the latest insights.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection

The solution uses Lambda functions to fetch marketing offer data and caps information from the Affise API:

- Pagination for handling large datasets
- Error handling with automatic retries
- Authentication via AWS Secrets Manager
- Data normalization for nested structures

### Data Processing

The data processing pipeline includes:

- Glue jobs for processing complex offer data structures
- ETL transformations to join and aggregate marketing metrics
- Athena SQL for analytics-ready data preparation
- Incremental processing to manage query timeouts

### Data Storage

Data is stored in a multi-layer approach:

- Raw data in JSON format
- Processed data in Parquet format for optimal query performance
- Final reporting tables accessible via Athena

## Operations

### Scheduling

The pipeline runs twice daily via EventBridge:

- **Morning Report**: 9:00 AM (Server Time)
- **Afternoon Update**: 2:00 PM (Server Time)

These scheduled runs ensure the QuickSight dashboards reflect up-to-date marketing performance metrics throughout the business day.

### Monitoring & Error Handling

- Step Functions execution tracking with visual workflow monitoring
- Automatic retries for transient API failures
- Detailed logging at each step

## Environment Configuration

### Lambda Functions

The project uses containerized Lambda functions with custom Docker images:

- `adstart_update_dimension_tables`: Fetches and processes offer data
- `export-sub5-report`: Exports finalized reports to S3

### AWS Glue ETL

Glue jobs like `adstart_sub5_get_offer_caps_data` process complex offer data structures:

- Extract caps data and affiliate relationships
- Format data for optimal query performance

### Athena Queries

Complex SQL transformations for reporting:

- Join dimensional data with fact tables
- Calculate performance metrics
- Filter and format for business requirements

### QuickSight Setup

The QuickSight dashboards are configured to:

- Connect directly to Athena data sources
- Use SPICE for accelerated dashboard performance
- Support row-level security for team-specific data views
- Provide email alerts for key performance metrics
- Enable scheduled report distribution to stakeholders

## Development and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Docker for Lambda function container builds
- Access to Affise API credentials
- QuickSight Enterprise subscription

### Deployment Steps

1. Create AWS resources (S3 buckets, IAM roles, etc.)
2. Deploy Lambda functions as containers
3. Create Glue jobs for ETL processing
4. Configure Step Functions workflow
5. Set up EventBridge triggers for scheduling
6. Configure QuickSight datasets and dashboards

## Future Enhancements

1. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Add automated data quality checks
2. **Dashboard Extensions**: Add additional QuickSight dashboards for deeper marketing insights
3. **Real-time Processing**: Add streaming capabilities for near real-time insights
4. **Enhanced Alerting**: Implement SNS notifications for critical failures
5. **ML Integration**: Incorporate predictive analytics for campaign performance

## Schedule & Execution

‚è∞ **Frequency**: Twice daily
‚è±Ô∏è **Execution Times**: 9:00 AM and 2:00 PM (Server Time)
üîÑ **Configuration**: EventBridge rules trigger Step Functions workflow
